## 4.1 Competitive Equilibrium

The behavior of each firm in the market depends on the structure of the market.

When we say market structure, we often refer to

* the number of firms in the market;
* the ease with which firms can enter and leave the market; and
* the ability of firms to differentiate their products from those of their rivals.

One of the main market structures we study in economics is the so called “competitive market”. In a competitive market, a single agent (either a firm or a consumer) cannot alter the market price with its sole actions[^1]. As a consequence, each of them takes prices as given and selects how much to buy or produce. Notice that the consumers and the firms we have studied so far behave in exactly this fashion.

Competitive markets typically exhibit the following characteristics:

* the products of the firms are almost identical from the perspective of the consumers;
* the consumers can easily get information about the prices of all ---or most--- sellers;
* there are many producers, so each of them represents a tiny fraction of the market;
* there are many consumers, so each of them represents a tiny fraction of the market;
* it is easy for each firm to enter and leave the market; and
* there is a relatively equal access to technology and inputs by the potential participants of the industry.

Some commodity markets (e.g. the soybeans market) operate close to perfect competition.

We often read in the newspapers about different policies that the government of the United States implements to make specific markets more competitive. A natural question arises:

$$Why \; are \; competitive\; markets\; desirable?$$

To answer this question, we need to introduce the concepts of consumer and producer surplus.

Consumer surplus is defined as the difference between consumers’ willingness to pay for a good and the price that they have to actually pay to buy each of the units that they decide to acquire. Graphically, it is the area below the demand curve and above the market price.

Producer surplus, on the other hand, is the difference between the price that the firms get for selling the good and the cost of producing each unit they put on the market.  Graphically, it is the area above the supply curve and below the price that producers are charging for the good.

Consumer surplus and producer surplus in a competitive market

Note: see an interactive version of this graph [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vuid1l2w2j).

The total surplus of the market is just the sum of consumer and producer surplus. Competitive markets are desirable as they maximize total surplus. Therefore, maximizing the total surplus will yield the competitive equilibrium

A competitive equilibrium indicates a market price at which the amount that the firms would like to produce equals the amount of the good that the consumers would like to buy. We can study this question in the short or in the long run.

# Short Run Industry Equilibrium

In the short run, we assume that the number of firms is fixed. In this case, the competitive equilibrium is given by the price level p* for which the total quantity that consumers are willing to demand $$(Q^d)$$ is the same as the total quantity that firms decide to supply $$(Q^s)$$. That is,

$$Q^d(p^* )=Q^s(p^* )$$

Now what if $$p \neq p^* $$? Well, the agents will exert pressure on the market price towards the equilibrium level.

<ins>Example</ins>: Suppose the demand curve is given by $$Q^d = 30 – p$$ and the supply curve is $$Q^s = 2p$$. If we calculate the equilibrium price $$p^* $$ and the equilibrium quantity $$Q^* $$ we get $$p^* = 10$$ and $$Q^* = 20$$.

If we draw the demand and supply curves and identify the surpluses graphically, we will see that those are triangles. Using the fact that the area of a triangle is base times height divided by two, then the consumer surplus (CS) is given by:

$$CS = \frac{(30-P^* )Q^* }{2} = \frac{(30-10)20}{2} = 200$$

Similarly, the producer surplus (PS) is given by:

$$PS = \frac{(P^* - 0 )Q^* }{2} = \frac{(10)20}{2} = 100 \quad ■$$

The following example is similar to the one just shown. However it focuses on deriving the $$(Q^d)$$ and $$(Q^s)$$ then solving for the short run competitive equilibrium.

<ins>Example</ins>: Suppose that there are 100 identical consumers with demand functions for a specific good given by

$$x = 75/p$$

In addition, lets assume that there are 12 identical firms, each of which has a supply function given by

$$y = p/4$$

Adding up the demand of each consumer, we get that the market demand is given by

$$Q^d(p)=100(75/p)=7500/p$$

Adding up the supply of each firm, we get that the market supply is given by

$$Q^s(p)=12(p/4)=3p$$

Thus, the short run competitive equilibrium price solves

$$7500/p = 3p$$

Thus, $$p^* = 50$$ and $$Q^* = 150$$ ■

In the two example we have seen so far we have dealt with linear supply and demand. We can generalize finding the competitive equilibrium. Let us find the equilibrium price $$p^* $$, by equating the supply and demand function.

$$ D(p) = a - bp $$

and

$$ S(p) = c + dp $$

Where (a,b,c,d) are simply the parameters that determine the slope and intercepts of the curves. Setting $$D(p)$$ equal to $$S(p)$$ the equilibrium price is found by the following

$$D(p) = a - bp= c + dp = S(p) \implies p^* = \frac{a-c}{d+b}$$

Thus the equilibrium quantity demand (and supply) is:

$$D(p^* ) = a-bp^* = a-b\frac{a-c}{b+d} = \frac{ad+bc}{b+d} $$

One last note before moving onto the long run equilibrium. We can also can find the equilibrium quantity and price from the inverse demand and supply. Intuitively, the inverse demand function ($$P_D (q)$$) measures the price that one is willing to pay in order to acquire a given amount of a good. Similarly, the inverse supply function ($$P_S (q)$$) measure the price one is willing to pay to produce a given amount of a good.

Using our linear curves from above we substitute $$q$$ for both $$D(p)$$ and $$S(p)$$ then solve both for $$p$$ we get the following:

$$P_D (q) = \frac{a-q}{b}$$

and

$$P_S (q) = \frac{q-c}{d}$$

setting $$P_D (q)$$ equal to $$P_S (q)$$ we see that

$$q^* = \frac{ad+bc}{b+d}$$

# Long Run Industry Equilibrium

Now we shift our focus to the the long run. In the long run, firms have the ability to adjust and choose their firms inputs and production factors.  This includes choosing capital equipment, choosing the factory size, or really anything to maximize their profits in the long run. What this means is that firms will move form their short run to their long run cost curves. For us this doesn't change how we approach finding the equilibrium analytically, we simply use the long run marginal cost curve to determine the long run supply curve.

However, there is an additional long run effect that occurs. If a firm is losing money in the long run there will be no reason to stay in the industry--rather they exit the market to minimize losses to zero. On the other hand if a firm is turning a profit they will enter the market. This implies that the only relevant part of a firms long run supply curve is the part that is either *on or above* the average cost curve.

In the long run, we assume that firms have enough time to make entry/exit decisions. Moreover we say there is free entry and exit if there are no barriers to enter or exit the industry. Most competitive industries exhibit free entry. However, some industries have barriers to entry. For example, many states have regulation that requires a specific license (such as liquor) in order to enter a certain retail industries.

Now we can start to define the long run equilibrium. The long run equilibrium consists of (P,Q,q,J) such that:

1. Where $$J$$ is the number of firms.
2. Price level such that every one that wants to buy (or sell) is able to. $$Q_d (P) =  Q_s (P)$$
3. Firms produce $$q$$ that maximizes profit is adjusting all inputs: for each firm: $$P= MC(q)$$ and $$P \geq AC$$
4. If $$P > minAC$$, firms will keep entering the market, supply will keep shifting rightward until profits are zero: That is to say $$P =minAC(q)$$

Now we will explain the intuition of this definition. Let's start by looking at a market which all the firms have identical long run cost functions, $$c(y)$$. Moreover, we can compute the level of output where average cost is minimized, $$q^* $$. Lastly, we let $$p^* = \frac{c(q^* )}{q^* }$$ be the minimum value of average cost. Now we can graph the industry supply curve for each firm (in reality there are many firms in a competitive industry but for this graph we only include 4 supply curves.)

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/markets/Fig24.3.PNG">

This graph captures the industry supply curves with free entry. Supply curves for
firms 1 - 4. The equilibrium price, $$p^′$$, occurs at the lowest possible intersection of demand and supply such that $$p^′ ≥ p^* $$.

Next, we construct *one* industry supply curve out of the $$n$$ curves we have (in this case 4). Note that we rule out points below $$p^* $$ since they cannot be operating points in the long run. We can also remove some points above $$p^* $$. Since the market demand curve is downward sloping, the steepest is a vertical line. Therefore points such as $$A$$ in the graph above would never be observed--as downward sloping demand curve that passed through $$A$$ would also have to intersect a supply curve associated with a larger number of firms, as shown by the hypothetical demand curve $$D^{′′}$$ passing through the point $$A$$.

Once we have eliminated the points that cannot be obtained we are left with the following graph.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/markets/Fig24.4.PNG">

The parts of each supply curve on which the long run can actually occur are indicated by the black line segments. Notice that as the level of industry output increase the line segments become flatter and flatter. It will become so flat that it becomes reasonable to take it as having a slope of zero. That is to say that the long run industry supply curve is a flat line at price equal to the minimum average cost.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/markets/Fig24.5.PNG">

Since there are 4 firms in the industry in the long run this graph ends up being a poor approximation of the supply curve. However if there are a reasonable number of firms in the long run the equilibrium price will not be far from the minimum average cost.

This leads to the concept of zero profits. In an industry with free entry and exit (like the one we have just seen) when there is significant levels of profits it will induce other firms to enter the industry which result in pushing the profits to zero. When profits are zero the industry doesn't disappear, rather it will stop growing as there is no longer incentive for firms to enter.

Now that we have defined the long run equilibrium and shown the intuition behind the definition we can show an example of how the long run industry equilibrium is solved.

<ins>Example</ins>:Consider an industry where all firms are identical and exhibit a cost function given by:

$$C(q) = 40q - q^2 + 0.01q^3$$

Moreover, assume that the demand function is given by $$Q^d(p) = 25000-1000p$$.

The long-run competitive equilibrium can be obtained as follows. First set $$p = MC$$ and $$p=AC$$

$$MC = 40-2q +.03q^2 = 40 - q + .01q^2 = AC$$

Solving for q gives us $$q^* = 50$$. Plugging $$q^* $$ into MC we get $$P^* = 15

Next, we find $$Q^* $$ from the market demand function:

$$Q^* = Q_d(p^* ) = 25,000 - 1,000(15) = 10,000$$

Lastly, we find the number of firms ,J, from $$Q_d(p) = Q_s(p)= Q^* $$

$$10,000 = (q^* )(J^* )= 50(J^* ) \implies J^* = 200$$

In sum, we have that $$p^* =15, Q^* =10,000$$ and $$J^* =200$$. ■

## 4.2 Taxes

# Taxes in the short run of the industry

Now we return to the short run and discuss taxes in short run of the industry. Namely we will focus on quantity taxes and value (ad valorem) taxes.

A quantity tax implies that part of the money paid for a unit of the good goes to the government. A common example is gasoline tax. Generally, if $$t$$ is the amount of the quantity tax is per unit then the quantity tax is defined as such:

$$P_D = P_S + t $$

To find the equilibrium condition with taxes we recall that $$D(P_D) = S(P_S)$$, but now we substitute in the quantity tax "equation"  so that our new equilibrium condition is $$D(P_D) = S(P_D-t)$$  (assuming the seller pays the tax)

A value tax--sometimes called an ad valorem tax--is expressed as a percentage. A sales tax is one common example of a value tax. In general, if the tax rate is denoted by $$\tau$$, the value tax is defined by:

$$P_D = (1+ \tau)P_S $$

To find the equilibrium condition, we simply plug in to get $$ D(P_D) = S(\frac{P_D}{1+\tau})$$ (again, assuming that the seller pays the tax)

When we defined the equilibrium condition for both quantity and value taxes we noted that those were the conditions if the seller paid the tax. But what if the buyer pays the tax? As an example consider a quantity tax $$t$$ that the buyer has to pay.

$$P_D - t = P_S $$

Note that this is the exact equation found above, just expressed differently. This implies that it does not matter if the tax is levied on the supply side or demand side--the burden of the tax will be distributed between the seller and buyer in the same way, regardless of the stated "intention" of the tax authority. The following graph highlights this

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/markets/Fig16.3.PNG">


Now lets see an example with linear demand and supply.

<ins>Example</ins>: Suppose that the demand and supply curves are both linear such that $$D(P_D) = a-bP_D$$ and $$S(P_S) = c+dP_S$$. A quantity tax is imposed with the seller paying the tax: $$P_D = P_S + t $$

We wish to find $$P_S^* $$ and $$P_D^* $$ therefore we set $$D(P_D) = S(P_D)$$ and solve for $$P_S^* $$ :

$$a-bP_D = c+dP_S$$

$$a-b(P_S + t ) = c+dP_S$$

$$P_S^* = \frac{a-c-bt}{d+b}$$

therefore, $$P_D^* = \frac{aS-c-bt}{d+b} + t$$ ■

As we’ve seen above, a tax really shouldn’t be regarded as a tax on firms or on consumers. Rather, taxes are on transactions between firms and consumers. Generally a tax will both raise the price paid by consumers and lower the price received by firms. How much of a tax gets "passed along" will therefore depend on the characteristics of demand and supply.

The two simplest cases regarding tax burdens is found in the two extremes of the supply curve.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/markets/Fig16.5.PNG">

Graph A exhibits a perfectly elastic supply curve (completely horizontal). This suggest that there are unlimited firms producing a good at a certain price and zero producing at any lower price. Any firm that wants to charge more, or less, than the going rate will be out of business in no time.

Graph B exhibits a perfectly inelastic supply curve (completely vertical). This suggest that a good produced is fixed and no tax will move its production. In this case, none of the tax gets passed on to the consumer.

Now that we understand the two simplest cases, we can examine the inbetween case where the supply curve has an upward slope but is not perfectly vertical. In this situation, the amount of the tax that gets passed along will depend on the steepness of the supply curve relative to the demand curve. If the supply curve is nearly horizontal, nearly all of the tax gets passed along to the consumers, while if the supply curve is nearly vertical, almost none of the tax gets passed along. The following graphs show some examples.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/markets/Fig16.6.PNG">

# Deadweight loss

We’ve seen that taxing a good will typically increase the price paid by the demanders and decrease the price received by the suppliers. This certainly represents a cost to the demanders and suppliers, but from the economist’s viewpoint, the real cost of the tax is that the output has been reduced. Let's explore this with a graph. The following graph shows the equilibrium demand and supply price *after* at tax, $$t$$, has been imposed.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/markets/Fig16.7.PNG">

Notice that with taxes a wedge between $$P_D$$ and $$P_S$$ is created (in fact: $$P_D > P_S$$). This means that some trasactions are lost. $$A+B$$ represent the losses in the consumer surplus. Similarly $$C+D$$ represent the losses in the producer surplus. The deadweight loss (or excess burden) is the "value" of transactions that would occur in an efficient mechanism, but do not occur due to the wedge created by the tax--namely $$(B+D)$$.  

However, the goverment is collecting taxes--is this enough to compensate for the loss? Looking back on our graph we see that this is not the case.

Note that we interpret of the loss of consumers’ surplus as how much the consumers would pay to avoid the tax. In terms of this diagram the consumers are willing to pay $$A + B$$ to avoid the tax. Similarly, the producers are willing to pay $$C + D$$ to avoid the tax. Together they are willing to pay $$A + B + C + D$$ to avoid a tax that raises $$A + C$$ dollars of revenue. The excess burden of the tax is therefore $$B + D$$.

Lastly, lets look at an numerical example of deadweight loss:

<ins>Example</ins>: Let our demand and supply functions be defined as such

$$Q^d=10−0.5P^d$$

and

$$Q^s=max(−2+P^s,0)$$

First lets find the equilibrium with no taxes:

* since $$Q_D = Q_S$$ and $$P_S = P_D = P^* $$
* Solving: $$P^* = 8$$ and $$Q^* = 6$$

Now consider a quantity tax of $6 and find the *equilibrium with tax*:

* The equilibrium now satisfies two equations :
* $$P_D = P_S + 6$$ and $$Q_D = Q_S $$
* Then we have $$ 10−0.5(P_s+6)=−2+P_s $$
* Solving for $$P_S$$ we get the following $$P_S = 6$$; $$P_D =12$$; $$Q^* =4$$ ■

Comparing the two equilibriums we see the effects of deadweight loss on a competitive market that is taxed.



## 4.3 Monopoly

We will now study an industry in which there is only one firm, a monopoly. We are interested in situations where this firm has power to set the market price. In this sense we are ruling out what we call contestable markets; these are markets where there is only one firm but if this firm increases the market price, then other firms will surely enter.

In a competitive market, producers determine best quantity for a given price (firms are **price-takers**). However in a monopoly, the firm can **either** determine the price and consumers decide how many units to buy (demand curve), or, equivalently, the firm determines the output and consumers determine the price (inverse demand $$p(q)$$ ). We will adopt the latter approach.

Monopolist cannot determine arbitrary $$q$$ and $$p$$ at the same time - the monopolist keeps in mind the demand of the consumer as a restriction, and chooses $$q$$ in order to maximize profit $$(\pi =p(q) × q)$$. Note that total revenue is equal to the product of price and quantity $$(TR(q)= p×q)$$. Unlike in a competitive firm the total revenue of a monopolist is not linear because the price changes with quantity ($$p(q)$$).

Now we can shift our focus to the monopolist profit maximization problem which is given by following formula:

$$max_q : \pi(q) = TR(q) - c(q)$$

Therefore we want to choose $$q$$ that gives the highest profits. Now if we think of the profit as a hill the peak of our profit hill must be flat right? Mathematically this is the first-order condition:

$$ \frac{d\pi}{dq} = \frac{dTR}{dq} - \frac{dc}{dq} = 0 $$

in other words monopolist are looking to produce $$q$$ such that:

$$MR(q) - MC(q) = 0 \implies MR(q) = MC(q)$$

We often denote this quantity as $$q^M$$

Before continuing lets look at the $$MR(q)$$ more closely (remember: although we do not always write it like that, remember that $$p$$ always represents the inverse demand, $$p(q)$$, in the monopoly case).

Since $$TR(q) = p(q) × q$$ then we have:

$$MR(q) = \frac{dTR(q)}{dq} = p(1- \frac{1}{\lvert \epsilon (q) \rvert})$$

Now instead of $$MR(q) = MC(q)$$, we have $$p(1- \frac{1}{\lvert \epsilon (q) \rvert}) = MC(q)$$. Since $$ (1- \frac{1}{\lvert \epsilon (q) \rvert})<1 $$, the monopolist will set $$p>MC$$. That is, the consumer pays more for an extra unit of production than what it costs **society** to produce that unit. This creates ineffciency!

In contrast, a competitive markets we had: $$price = MC$$. Also notice that the monopolist produces at a $$q^M $$ such that: $$\lvert \epsilon \rvert > 1$$.

<ins>Example</ins>: lets look an example of a monopoly that faces a linear inverse demand curve $$p = a - bq$$ and has the cost function $$c(q) = cq$$ where $$a,b,c > 0$$

The profit maximization problem is:
$$max_q: \pi = TR(q) - c(q) = (a-bq)q - cq$$

1. First we find *marginal revenue* and *marginal cost* functions:

$$MR(q) = a-2bq \quad and \quad MC(q) = c$$

2. Next we equate the two and solve for $$q:$$ $$a-2bq = c$$. It follows that: $$q^M = \frac{(a-c)}{2b}$$

3. Plug $$q^M$$ into the inverse demand function and find the price of the monopolist: $$p^M = \frac{(a+c)}{2}$$.■


<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/markets/Fig25.1.PNG">

<ins>Example</ins>: Now lets see a numerical example. SC Municipal Utility is the sole provider of water to Santa Cruz residents and faces the following demand for water (in gallons): $$q^d=100-p$$. Also, $$TC =2q$$

Step 1: find the inverse demand function: $$p = 100-q^d$$

Step 2: Find the MR and MC:

$$TR = Pq = (100-q)q = 100q -q^2 $$

$$MR = \frac{dTR}{dq} = 100 -2q \quad and \quad MC = \frac{dTC}{dq} = 2$$

Step 3: Set $$MR = MC$$ and find $$q^M$$

$$2 = 100 - 2q \implies q^M = 49$$

Step 4: Find $$p^M$$ by plugging $$q^M$$ into the inverse demand:

$$p^M = 100 - q^M = 51$$■

Before moving on lets briefly discuss the impact of taxes on a monopolist. Let consider a firm with constant marginal cost and a linear demand curve. Clearly, MC goes up by the amount of the tax, but what about the market price?

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/markets/Fig25.3.PNG">

When the marginal cost curve, $$MC$$, shifts up by the amount of the tax to $$MC+t$$, the intersection of marginal revenue and marginal cost moves to the left. Since the demand curve is half as steep as the marginal revenue curve, the price goes up by *half the amount of the tax*.

# Deadweight loss of the monopoly

A competitive industry operates at a point where **price equals marginal cost**. A monopolized industry operates where **price is greater than marginal cost**. Thus in general the price will be higher and the output will be lower if a firm behaves monopolistically rather than competitively. For this reason, consumers will typically be worse off in an industry organized as a monopoly than in one organized competitively. However, for the same reason that consumers are worse off, the firm is better off.

In a monopoly, there are consumers that are willing to pay more than what it would cost to make those extra units (MC), but they are priced out. This would not happen in a competitive market. Let us consider $$(Q_M,P_M)$$ as the optimal production set of a monopolist and $$(Q_C,P_C)$$ the optimal production for a competitive firm.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/markets/Fig25.4.PNG">

This graph reinforces the fact that a monopoly is inefficient by showing the optimal operating point for both a competitive firm and a monopolized firm.

In general, the monopoly produces less output than firms in a competitive market. Moreover, for some of the extra units that competitive markets would produce people are willing to pay more than the cost of producing them. Thus, a natural question arises:

$$Why \; doesn't \; the \; monopoly \; increase \; production?$$


The reason is that to convince people to buy these extra units, the firm needs to lower the market price not only to the new consumers, but also to all of them! The deadweight loss is the difference in consumer surplus and producer surplus between a competitive market and the monopoly.

The change in the producer’s and consumers’ surplus from a movement from monopolistic to competitive output are seen in the following graph. The monopolist’s surplus goes down by $$A$$ due to the lower price on the units he was already selling. It goes up by $$C$$ due to the profits on the extra units it is now selling. The consumers’ surplus goes up by $$A$$, since the consumers are now getting all the units they were buying before at a cheaper price; and it goes up by $$B$$, since they get some surplus on the extra units that are being sold. The area $$A$$ is just a transfer from the monopolist to the consumer; one side of the market is made better off and one side is made worse off, but the total surplus doesn’t change.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/markets/Fig25.5.PNG">


The deadweight loss $$(B+C)$$ provides a measure of how much worse off people are paying the monopoly  price than paying the competitive price. The deadweight loss due to monopoly, like the deadweight loss due to a tax, measures the value of the lost output by valuing each unit of lost output at the price that people are willing to pay for that unit.

# Natural monopoly

It would seem that regulating a monopoly to eliminate the inefficiency is pretty easy solution—-all the regulator has to do is to set price equal to marginal cost, and profit maximization will do the rest. Unfortunately, this analysis leaves out one important aspect of the problem: it may be that the monopolist would make negative profits at such a price. This type of situation is called a natural monopoly.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/markets/Fig25.6.PNG">

Here the minimum point of the average cost curve is to the right of the demand curve, and the intersection of demand and marginal cost lies underneath the average cost curve. Even though the level of output $$q_{MC}$$ is efficient, it is not profitable. If a regulator set this level of output, the monopolist would prefer to go out of business.

Examples of natural monopolies are often seen with public utilites. Think about a local telephone company. providing the wires and switching networks requires a very large fixed cost, yet the marginal cost of another unit of telephone service is very low. When there are large fixed costs and small marginal costs, you can easily get the kind of situation seen in the above graph.

# What causes monopolies?

We have seen monopolies and how they are inefficient. However, we have yet to discuss what it is that causes monopolies to arise. There are a few factors that can lead to monopolies:

* Essential facility: Controlling a scarce resource that any rival firm would need. For example, owning the only quarry in a region generates a cost advantage in the production of gravel.
* Superior technology: That is, a better way of organizing production. For example, Henry Ford's assembly lines and standardization.
* Patents: These are licenses that protect a firm from imitation of technologies or informational secrets. For example, many pharmaceutical companies.
* Network Externalities: Consumers benefit from using the same product as everyone else. Gives incumbent firm advantage. For example, Facebook and Ebay
* History of fighting entry via price wars or costly advertising campaigns.

Mathematically, the minimum efficient scale (MES) is the crucial factor in determining if a market will most likely be a monopoly or not. The MES is the level of output that minimizes average cost relative to the size of demand. The graph below illustrates the MES. Consider a market with many firms (A) where each firm is charging a price close to $$p^* $$ and each firm is operating at a small scale. We expect his market to be a competitive one as its demand is large relative to the MES scale. On the other hand consider a market where only one firm can make positive profits (B). Its demand is small relative to the MES scale so we would expect this market to operate as a monopoly.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/markets/Fig25.7.PNG">

Another reason why monopolies might occur is when a few firms in an industry collude with one another to artificially hike price to the monopolist level. Doing this would not only increase their own profits but it would also help drive out competition. When firms engage in this type of behavior we say that the industry is organized as a cartel. Typically cartels are illegal (in the United States)--yet the biggest cartel in the world is OPEC, they own 80% of the worlds reserves in oil. This is because the US courts do not have jurisdiction in foreign anti-trust cases. Unfortunately, OPEC has used their influence to cause a massive shortage of gasoline. In 1973, due to retaliation from US involvement in the Yom Kippur War, OPEC imposed an oil embargo.

We will come back to cartels when we discuss oligopolies.

# Price discrimination

Until now we assumed the monopolist charged all the consumers the same market price for the good. There are many situations where this assumption does not hold. That is, situations where this firm sets different prices to different consumers.

In this section, we study three different types of price discrimination:

* First-degree price discrimination: Prices differ from person to person.

* Second-degree price discrimination: Prices depend on quantities.

* Third-degree price discrimination: Prices differ across people but depend on observable characteristics (e.g., age or students vs non-students).

**First-degree price discrimination**

This is the simplest type of price discrimination and is also known as **perfect price discrimination**. In this case, the monopolist selects a different price for each consumer. Ideally, this price captures the maximum willingness to pay for the consumer! An example of this type of behavior is seen in bargaining

We showed before that the regular monopolist produces less than the optimal output level ---i.e., the one that maximizes social welfare. The reason is that, when it produces more units of the good, it has to lower the price of all previous units in order to sell the extra output. Thus,

$$What\; if \;we \;allow\; the\; monopoly\; to\; charge\; different\; prices \;to \;different \;consumers?$$

If we do so, then the monopolist would produce an efficient level of outcome!

Consider the diagram below, which illustrates two consumers’ demand curves for a good. Think of a reservation price model for demand where the individuals choose integer amounts of the goods and each step in the demand curve represents a change in the willingness to pay for additional units of the good. We have also illustrated (constant) marginal cost curves for the good.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/markets/Fig26.1.PNG">

A producer who is able to perfectly price discriminate will sell each unit of the good at the highest price it will command, that is, at each consumer’s reservation price. Since each unit is sold to each consumer at his or her reservation price for that unit, there is no consumers’ surplus generated in this market; all the surplus goes to the producer. The colored area indicates the surplus the monopolist is accumulating. Since the producer gets all the surplus in the market, its goal is to maximizes producer surplus subject to the constraint that the consumers are just willing to purchase the good.

Alternatively we can think of first degree price discrimination as selling a fixed amount of the good at a “take it or leave it” price. In the following diagram the monopolist would offer to sell $$x_1^0$$ units of the good to person 1 at a price equal to the area under person 1’s demand curve and offer to sell $$x_2^0$$ units of the good to person 2 at a price equal to the area under person 2’s demand curve $$B$$.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/markets/Fig26.2.PNG">

As before, each person would end up with zero consumer’s surplus, and the entire surplus of $$A+B$$ would end up in the hands of the monopolist.

There are, however, at least two problems with this type of price discrimination:

* From the perspective of the monopoly, it is hard to implement due to lack of information.
* From the perspective of the society, consumer surplus is zero.

Therefore, first degree price discrimination is primarily a theoretical concept and it is hard to find many real-world examples. But as we mentioned before one possible example is bargaining. The type we would see at a car dealership or antique markets.

**Second-Degree Price Discrimination**

This is a non-linear pricing scheme in which the market price depends on the amount of the good that the consumer gets, e.g., discounts by quantity. This form of price discrimination is commonly used by public utilities; for example, the price per unit of electricity often depends on how much is bought. In other industries bulk discounts for large purchases are sometimes available.

The monopolist offers different packages--that differ in number of units and market price--and each consumer "self-selects" into the most attractive one. The purpose of the monopoly is to design the menus so that people self-select into the package that is more convenient for the firm.

To see how this works lets look at the same diagrams with the “take it or leave it” price. Note that we have set the marginal cost equal to zero to simplify the argument

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/markets/Fig26.3.PNG">

The monopolist would like to offer $$x_1^0$$ at price $$A$$ and $$x_2^0$$ to capture all the surplus and hence generate the most profit. However, this is not compatible with self-selection as the high demand consumer would simply find $$x_1^0$$ optimal and leave the monopolist with surplus equal to area B. To remedy this the monopolist can offer $$x_2^0$$ at price $$A+C$$ in order to get the high demand consumer to chose $$x_2^0$$ over $$x_1^0$$.

There’s yet a further thing the monopolist can do to increase profits. Suppose that instead of offering $$x_1^0$$ at price $$A$$ to the low-demand consumer, the monopolist offers a bit less than that at a price slightly less than A. This reduces the monopolist’s profits on person 1 by the small colored triangle illustrated in graph $$B$$. Now that person 1's package is less attractive to person 2 the monopolist can charge person 2 more for $$x_2^0$$!

The Monopolist will reduce the amount offered to person 1 up to the point where the profit lost on person 1 due to a further reduction in output just equals the profit gained on person 2. Graph $$C$$ illustrate this Person 1 chooses $$x_1^m$$ and is charged $$A$$; person 2 chooses $$x_2^0$$ and is charged $$A + C + D$$. Person 1 ends up with a zero surplus and person 2 ends up with a surplus of $$B$$—just what he would $$m$$ get if he chose to consume $$x_1^m$$.

In practice, the monopolist often encourages this self-selection not by adjusting the quantity of the good, but rather by adjusting the quality of the good.In general, the monopolist will want to reduce the quality offered to the low end of its market so as not to cannibalize sales at the high end. Without the high-end consumers, the low-end consumers would be offered higher quality, but they would still end up with zero surplus. Without the low-end consumers, the high-end consumers would have zero surplus, so it is beneficial to the high end consumers to have the low-end consumers present.

**Third-Degree Price Discrimination**

Third-degree price discrimination is the most common form of price discrimination. Suppose that the monopoly can identify two groups of people (based on observable characteristics such as age) with individual demands $$p_1(q_1)$$ and $$p_2(q_2)$$. Examples include senior citizen discounts or student discounts.

Let us use $$p_1(q_1)$$ and $$p_2(q_2)$$ to denote the inverse demand curves of groups 1 and group 2, respectively, and let $$C(q_1 + q_2)$$ be the cost of producing output. Then the profit maximization problem is

$$max_{q_1,q_2} \{p_1(q_1)q_1+p_2(q_2)q_2- C(q_1+q_2)\}$$

Thus, the FOC’s for the monopolist are given by

$$p_1(q_1) + p_1^{\prime}(q_1)q_1 - C^{\prime}(q_1+q_2)$$ (FOC1)\\
$$p_2(q_2) + p_2^{\prime}(q_2)q_2 - C^{\prime}(q_1+q_2)$$ (FOC2)

where $$p_i^{\prime}(q_i)=\frac{\partial p_i(q_i)}{\partial q_i}$$ and  $$C^{\prime}(q_1+q_2)=\frac{C(q_1+q_2)}{\partial q_i}$$ for $$i=1,2$$.

The solution of the problem can be re-written as follows

$$p_1(q_1^* )= \frac{MC(q_1^* +q_2^* )}{(1-\frac{1}{\lvert \epsilon_1(q_1^* )\rvert})} \quad and \quad p_2(q_2^* )= \frac{MC(q_1^* +q_2^* )}{(1-\frac{1}{\lvert \epsilon_2(q_2^* )\rvert})}$$

Thus, the price of the monopolist is larger for the group with the lower elasticity of demand! This is expected as elastic demand is a price sensitive demand. A firm that price discriminates will therefore set a low price for the price sensitive group and a high price for the group that is relatively price insensitive. In this way it maximizes its overall profits.

This explains why we see those discounts--it is more likely that students and seniors citizens are more sensitive to price than the average consumer and thus have more elastic demands for the relevant region of prices. Therefore a profit maximizing firm will price discriminate in their favor.

## 4.4 Oligopoly

In the previous section we discussed an industry in which a single firm is the sole provider of a particular commodity--namely a monopoly. In this section we shift our focus to the oligopoly. By oligopoly we mean an industry with a few firms that behave strategically. To simplify the exposition, we will mainly consider an industry with only two firms (i.e., a duopoly). Also we will limit ourselves to investigation of cases in which each firm is producing an identical product. This allows us to avoid the problems of product differentiation and focus only on strategic interactions.

Oligopolies also differ from monopolies in that there is no general solution to the equilibrium of this market. It will depend on market structure and specifics of how firms interact. In this section we will see oligopolies in which the agents collude with one another and oligopolies with agents that do not collude.

# Collusive oligopoly

A collusive oligopoly is when firms get together to maximize joint profits. In the previous section we discussed how OPEC was a cartel. Specifically OPEC consists of 13 nations (or firms) that together control 80% of the worlds reserves in oil. However while as a single entity OPEC acts as a monopoly, in reality OPEC is a prime example of what a collusive oligopoly.

Natrually, a collusive oligopoly and a monopoly are similar in that finding the profit maximization is almost identical.

First we have total quantity: $$Q = q_1 + q_2$$ while inverse demand: $$p(Q) = p(q_1 + q_2)$$

The cartels profit is given by: $$ \pi(q_1 , q_2) = p(q_1 + q_2) × (q_1 + q_2)- c(q_1) - c(q_2)$$.

the profit maximum problem is: $$max_{q_1,q_2}:p(q_1+q_2)×(q_1+q_2)−c(q_1)−c(q_2)$$

The FOCs:

With respect to $$q_1$$: $$p(q_1+q_2)+ \frac{dp}{dq_1} × (q_1+q_2)=MC(q_1)$$

With respect to $$q_2$$: $$p(q_1+q_2)+ \frac{dp}{dq_2} × (q_1+q_2)=MC(q_2)$$

Lastly, the cartels $$MR$$ must equate to both $$MC(q_1)$$ and $$MC(q_2)$$■

<ins>Example</ins>: Now lets look at the cartel in the linear case. Note that this cartel is a duopoly and both firms divide the production equally.

Let market inverse demand be: $$p = a−bQ = a−b(q_1+q_2)$$ and let the cost function be: $$TC_i = cq_i$$, so $$MC_i = c$$

Then the cartel's profits is: $$\pi(q_1+q_2)=(a−bq_1−bq_2)(q_1+q_2)−cq_1−cq_2$$

Thus the FOC with respect to $$q_1$$: $$a−2bq_1−2bq_2=c$$
*(Note that FOC $$q_1$$ = FOC $$q_2$$)*

Now this implies that $$q_1 +q_2 = \frac{a-c}{2b}$$

Since the firm divide production equally: $$q_1^{cartel}=q_2^{cartel}=\frac{a−c}{4b}$$■

By now, one might be wondering:

$$Why \; don't \;we \;see \;more \;cartels \;in \;real \;life? $$

Well, as we previously mentioned cartels are illegal in the United States. So that sheds some light as to why we do not see many cartels in the United States. Perhaps more importantly, cartels are hard to sustain. In fact cartels have a built-in instability. If firm 1 believes firm 2 will indeed follow the agreement, then it should increase its own output. Furthermore, if a firm believes the other firm will not keep its word, then it should cheat first.

# Non-collusive oligopolies

As the name suggests non-collusive oligopolies consists of firms that do not collude with one another. Rather these firms act independently even though the firms are interdependent in the market.

We will study three types of competition in the form of duopolies:

* Cournot: Firms compete by choosing quantities.
* Bertrand: Firms compete by choosing prices.
* Stackelberg: One firm is the leader and the other one is the follower.

**Duopoly of Cournot**

The models is as folllows:

1. There are two firms in the market that compete in quantities.
2. Each firm selects how much to produce in order to maximize profits, taking as given the decision of the other firm.
3. Firms face a **linear demand** $$P(q_1,q_2)=a-b(q_1+q_2)$$.
4. Firms have the same **linear cost** of production $$C_i(q_i)=cq_i$$ for $$i=1,2$$.

Given this information, the profits of these firms are given by

$$\pi_1(q_1,q_2) = [a-b(q_1+q_2)]q_1-cq_1$$ \\
$$\pi_2(q_1,q_2) = [a-b(q_1+q_2)]q_2-cq_2$$

Then, the FOC’s of both firms are

$$ \frac{\partial \pi_1(q_1,q_2)}{\partial q_1} = a-c-2bq_1-bq_2=0$$ \\
$$ \frac{\partial \pi_2(q_1,q_2)}{\partial q_2} = a-c-2bq_2-bq_1=0$$

From the FOC’s we derive the reaction function of each firm

$$q_1(q_2)=(a-c-bq_2)/2b  \quad and \quad  q_2(q_1)=(a-c-bq_1)/2b$$

These functions indicate how much a firm would like to produce if it expects a certain production level from the other firm.

Cournot Equilibrium

The equilibrium is given by the pair of quantities $$(q_1^* ,q_2^* )$$ that solve

$$q_1(q_2^* )=q_1^*  \quad  and \quad  q_2(q_1^* )=q_2^* $$

This pair requires both that each firm behaves optimally given what it expects the other firm will do, and that their predictions are correct. In this application, we get

$$ q_1^* = q_2^* = \frac{(a-c)}{3b} $$  

and

$$p^* = \frac{a-2(a-c)}{3} $$

Given this result, the profits of the firms are given by

$$ \pi_1 = \frac{(a-c)^2}{9b} = \pi_2 =\frac{(a-c)^2}{9b}$$

This is an example of what we call Nash equilibrium--a concept that we will come across again.

In general Each firm makes a choice of output, $$q_i$$, given its forecast of the other firm’s output, $$q_j^e$$ where $$e$$ stands for *expected* output. If, for example, $$q_1$$ = chosen output of Firm 1, and $$q_2^e$$ = Firm 1’s beliefs about Firm 2’s chosen output.

Then, Firm 1's maximization problem: $$max_{q_1}:\pi_1(q_1 \lvert q_2^e)=p(q_1+q_2^e)×q_1−c(q_1)$$. Thus the FOC of Firm 1 is given by:

$$ \frac{d\pi_1}{dq_1}=0 \implies p(q_1+q_2^e)+ \frac{dp}{dq_1}×q_1=MC_1(q_1)$$

Thus solving for $$q_1$$ the reaction curve for Firm 1 is: $$q_1 = f_1(q_2^e)$$
Similarly, Firm 2 also has a reaction curve: $$q_2=f_2(q_1^e)$$

Therefore, the  Cournot equilibrium is: $$q_1^C=q_1^e; q_2^C=q_2^e; p^C=p(q_1^C+q_2^C)$$.

the following diagram illustrates the Cournot equilibrium

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/markets/Fig28.4.PNG">

Now suppose we are dealing with more than two firms in the Cournot oligopoly (i.e no longer a duopoly). Suppose now that there are $$n$$ firms, and let $$Q=q_1+...+q_n$$ be the total output.

Since $$\pi (q_i)=p(Q)×q_i−c(q_i)$$, we can use the fact that $$\frac{dp}{dq_i}=\frac{dp}{dQ}$$ to write the FOCs of firm $$i$$ as follows: $$p(Q)+\frac{dp}{dQ}q_i=MC(q_i)$$, where the left-hand side is simply the MR of firm $$i$$.

There are a total of $$n$$ FOC equations like this one (since $$i=1,2,3,...,n$$) and so you will have a system of $$n$$ equations and $$n$$ unknowns that you can solve to find $$q_1^C,q_2^C,...,q_n^C$$.

In the case of the the linear inverse demand $$(p = a - bQ)$$ and constant marginal cost $$(MC = c)$$, the equilibrium of the *n-firm Cournot oligopoly* is given by:

$$q_i^C=\frac{a−c}{(n+1)b} \quad and \quad p^C = \frac{a+nc}{n+1}$$

Lastly, as an intresting exercise think about what happens when $$n \rightarrow \infty$$

**Duopoly of Bertrand**

Now suppose that two firms have identical costs (say, $$MC = c$$) and they produce identical goods. Firm 1 believes Firm 2 will charge $$p_2$$ and decides to charge $$p_1$$ upon that belief--both set prices simultaneously.

Because any firm that undercuts its rival captures the entire market and earns positive profit, firms will undercut each other until they hit their $$MC$$. That is, while possible $$p_1$$ will always be set just below $$p_2^e$$ or at $$MC$$ if $$MC>p_2^e$$.

These incentives make the simultaneous price setters to push their price down to the Bertrand Equilibrium. The model is as follows:

1. There are two firms in the market--producing an identical good--- that compete in prices.
2. Each firm selects its market price in order to maximize its own profits, taking as given the price of the other firm.
3. Firms have the same linear cost of production $$C_i(q_i)=cq_i$$

The equilibrium of this model is very simple: price = $$MC$$: $$p_1^B =p_2^B =MC$$

Notice that this equilibrium is the same as the competitive one! Whenever one of the firms selects a price above c, then the other firm has incentives to choose a price just below the one by the initial firm. The reason is that the good produced by the two firms is identical and thus, by doing so, the second firm can get the whole market. This process repeats till the above condition is reached.

Competition is tougher when firms compete in prices than when they choose quantities!

**Duopoly of Stackelberg**

In the Stackelberg duopoly there is a leader and a follower. The leader is fully aware that the follower will act after him, and so that the follower will affect the market price. The leader then needs to analyze what the follower will choose.

The model is as follows:

1. Two firms in the market, Firm 1 is the leader and Firm 2 is the follower.
2. Firm 1 (often larger than Firm 2) chooses first how much to produce. Firm 2 observes the decision of Firm 1, and then selects how much to produce.
3. The demand and cost functions are as before.

To solve this problem we study first the decision of the Follower, and then the one of the Leader. That is the Leader will "solve" the Follower's problem, first. Then she incorporates that insight to find out her optimal Leader output level. From a mathematical perspective, this technique is called back induction.

The Follower observes the production level of the Leader. Then, Follower's profit maximization function is:

$$max_{q_2}: \pi_2=p(q_1+q_2)×q_2−c_2(q_2)$$

Where the Leader's output is treated as a constant. Finding $$MR=MC$$:

$$MR_2=p(q_1+q_2)+ \frac{\partial p}{\partial q}q_2=MC_2$$

This looks a lot like a monopolist's maximization except with a "residual demand" (demand that the Leader left unserved). So the profit maximizing choice will depend on the choices of the Leader.

Solving for $$q_2$$ from that FOC we can get the Follower's reaction function:

$$q_2=f_2(q_1)$$

The Leader's Profit maximization is:

$$max_{q_1}: \pi_1=p(q_1+f_2(q_1))× q_1−c_1(q_1)$$

Note: output of the Follower is NOT treated as a constant here.

As always, the Leader solves for his optimal $$q_1^S$$ by doing: $$\frac{d\pi_1}{dp_1} = 0$$ to obtain $$q_1^S$$

Therefore the equilibrium:

$$q_1^S , q_2^S = f_2(q_1^S) , p^S=p(q_1^S+q_2^S)$$

Now that we have seen the general case of the Stackelberg oligopoly we will explore the linear case in this next example.

<ins>Example</ins>: Let the market inverse demand: $$p = a−bQ=a−b(q_1+q_2)$$. Also let costs: $$TC_i=cq_i$$, so $$MC_i=c$$

The first step to finding the Stackelberg equilibrium is having the Leader "solve" the Follower's profit maximization problems:

$$max_{q_2}:\pi_2=(a−b(q_1+q_2)) q_2−cq_2$$


The FOC for the problem of the Follower is given by

$$ \frac{\partial \pi_2(q_1,q_2)}{\partial q_2} = a-c-2bq_2-bq_1=0$$


Thus the Follower's reaction function is:

$$q_2=f_2(q_1)=\frac{a-c}{2b} - \frac{1}{2}q_1$$

The next step is for the Leader to solve his own profit maximization problem with the insight found in step 1. Then, its profit function is given by

$$ max_{q_1} = \pi_1 = (a-b(q_1+f_2(q_1)))q_1-cq_1$$

That is:


$$(a-b(q_1+ \frac{a-c}{2b} - \frac{1}{2}q_1))q_1-cq_1$$

The FOC for the Leader is given by:$$ \frac{\partial \pi_1}{\partial q_1} 0$$ It follows that the Leader's final level of production:

$$q_1^S =\frac{(a-c)}{2b}$$


The final step is to use $$q_1^S$$ to calculate $$q_2=f_2(q_1)$$. Recall that $$Q = q_1 +q_2$$ and $$p^S = a-bQ$$

Thus the Stackelberg Equilibrium:

$$q_1^S = \frac{(a-c)}{2b}, q_2^S = f_2(q_1) = \frac{(a-c)}{2b}, p^S = \frac{a+3c}{4}$$. ■

The following diagram helps to give a visual idea of the Stackelberg oligopoly

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/markets/Fig28.2.PNG">

[^1]:This structure is often referred to as a perfectly competitive market.
